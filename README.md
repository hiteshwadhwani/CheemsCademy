# E-Learning

When compared to traditional learning systems, e-learning satisfies the need for knowledge by providing online content that can be supplied to the learner at any time, at any location, and at any age. It also allows for quick access to specialized knowledge and data. The learning approach has altered as a result of the rapid increase of numerous knowledge sources and time constraints. Rather than teaching and learning by hand, learners receive knowledge using e-Learning technologies. The e-learning management system with a web services-oriented framework is proposed in this research report.
